Daniel Timonthy Berg

Introduction

I am currently trying to get a career in the computer science field. I am currently employed at Kroger in Fort Wayne as a Courtesy Clerk. My dream job would be to become a video game programmer or designer. I am very close to my family. I have also participated in a Smash Bros Esports League when I was in High School.

My educational background

I have graduated high school with my academic honors. I am currently still a student at Ivy Tech working to get my Associate's degree in Computer Science. My plan is to stay at Ivy Tech for two years then transfer to PFW(Purdue Fort Wayne) to then get my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Programming languages that I am proficient in

I would say that I am proficient in C++/C# and somewhat of Java. I am currently taking a class in Ivy Tech about Java and I am becoming more and more proficient in Java each day I am in that class. As for C++/C# I did a Computer Science course via Ivy Tech last fall that went over the basics of C++/C# and I will be continuing that class in the Spring during my second 8 weeks/second quarter. 

Projects in Progress

I am currently working on a final project for my Java class. This project will be a Java snake game like in the arcades. I am currently in the process of putting it into a GUI and getting my Direction class (The class that allows users to move the snake in which direction they choose) up and running.
